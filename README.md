This app will be a forum template page featuring an account system, categorized threads, and general settings to customize the forum to the needs of the users.

When working locally, if you have to make a new view, in order to implement bootstrap, please include the css before </head> tag and the jquery followed by bootstrap scripts before the </body> tag in each view.

Also, be sure to set the base path in config.php to your local server path.
